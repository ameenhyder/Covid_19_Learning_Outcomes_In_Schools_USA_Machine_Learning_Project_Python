Data Gathering:

1. We have state/district/school level data for couple of years. In each data set we have percentage of student falling in
	each level 1-5. Also we have mean scale score. The data is for various grades 3 to 8, english and mathematics (further 
	categorizaiton can be explored) 

2. We have data for colarado, florida and NY. We will keep the scope limited to these three states only. 

3. Above three data sets will be supplemented by CCD data, other demographics, economic and social indicators 
	to make our data rich. The data sources that we can use CCD, census data, covid19-data, mode-of-learning etc.

Data Pre-processing:

3. The pre-processing will be done for each data sets of each three states--> this will take a lot of time as 
	data tables, naming conventions, aggregation level of each state is different. --> one coherent 
	data frame will be formed for the analysis.

4. The supplementary data sets will be joined with the above table to enrich it. 

Modeling:

1. Mean Scale Score for each school/district will be used as a metric

2. Using the data of 2017/2018/2019 --> the growth of 2020/21/22 will be predicted (exact years will be identified
	once the data is cleaned)
	
	2.1. For this growth model will be used as identified int the harvard paper
	2.2. We can also think of applying some other sophisticated ML algos like ANN, CNN. 

3. Using expected growth and real growth --> the academic loss with be calculated. 

4. Time to recover academic loss --> For this some metric would be calculated like avg. growth points per year.
	Since there would be deficit in academic acheivement, it would be calculated how much more years/time
	required to achieve same level of growth in the coming years.
